0x1A. C - Hash tables
Introduction
This README provides a concise overview of hash tables in C, a data structure used for efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval.

Key Points
Hash tables use a hash function to map keys to specific positions.
They handle collisions using chaining (linked lists) or open addressing.
Essential components include the hash function, bucket structure, and collision resolution strategy.
Common operations include insertion, retrieval, deletion, and resizing.
Usage
Here's a simple usage example:

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>
#include "hashtable.h"

int main() {
    // Create and use a hash table
    // ...
    return 0;
}
Best Practices
Choose a good hash function.
Monitor the load factor and resize as needed.
Handle collisions efficiently.
Free allocated memory when done.
